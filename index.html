    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
        Formed initially by childhood friends Tyler Glenn and Chris Allen who both grew up in Murrieta, California, the
        band made its first home in Provo, Utah after Glenn and Allen moved there from Southern California. Eventually,
        the current group was rounded out by fellow Mormons Branden Campbell and Elaine Bradley. David Charles currently
        plays with the band as touring guitarist.

        The band first started playing under the name Neon Trees in late 2005 with five original members: Tyler Glenn and
        Chris Allen from California, and three veterans of the Utah music scene, bass player Mike Liechty, drummer Jason
        Gibbons and keyboardist Nathan Evans. The band's name was inspired by the lighted trees on the In-N-Out Burger
        signs. They released an EP, <i>Becoming Different People</i>, in 2006 during their first tour through California. The
        EP featured promising songs like "Phones", "Sister Stereo", "Up Against the Glass".
        Soon after, the lineup narrowed down to four members with Branden Campbell and Elaine Bradley joining the group
        on bass and drums, respectively. In 2007, The Killers' drummer, Ronnie Vannucci Jr., went to watch the band play at a small club in Las Vegas as
        he had previously been in a band called "Attaboy Skip" with Neon Trees bassist Branden Campbell prior to joining
        The Killers. Ronnie was impressed, and as a result they were chosen to open for The Killers for a string of
        dates on their 2008 North American tour. Vannucci later helped the band sign to major label Mercury Records.

        Although they had several prior independent releases, the band released its debut album on Mercury/Island Def
        Jam, <i>Habits</i>, on March 16, 2010. "Animal" was chosen as the lead single, and the band went on to preform
        the song live in many famous venues. It was even featured in a commercial for Las Vegas. The band's next two
        albums <i>Picture Show</i> and <i>Pop Psychology</i> were released in 2011 and 2014, respectively.
        Since that first album release, Neon Trees has enjoyed ever growing sucess. They have preformed live on talk
        shows, have had songs featured in commercials, and performed with famous musicians from Maroon 5 and Taylor
        Swift to Duran Duran and the Flaming Lips. Neon Trees has continued to rise to the top in a steady arc fueled by
        their catchy, dancable, pop-rock sound.
